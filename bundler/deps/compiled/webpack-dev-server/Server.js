/**
 * A dependency-injected version of the [async.auto]{@link module:ControlFlow.auto} function. Dependent
 * tasks are specified as parameters to the function, after the usual callback
 * parameter, with the parameter names matching the names of the tasks it
 * depends on. This can provide even more readable task graphs which can be
 * easier to maintain.
 *
 * If a final callback is specified, the task results are similarly injected,
 * specified as named parameters after the initial error parameter.
 *
 * The autoInject function is purely syntactic sugar and its semantics are
 * otherwise equivalent to [async.auto]{@link module:ControlFlow.auto}.
 *
 * @name autoInject
 * @static
 * @memberOf module:ControlFlow
 * @method
 * @see [async.auto]{@link module:ControlFlow.auto}
 * @category Control Flow
 * @param {Object} tasks - An object, each of whose properties is an {@link AsyncFunction} of
 * the form 'func([dependencies...], callback). The object's key of a property
 * serves as the name of the task defined by that property, i.e. can be used
 * when specifying requirements for other tasks.
 * * The `callback` parameter is a `callback(err, result)` which must be called
 *   when finished, passing an `error` (which can be `null`) and the result of
 *   the function's execution. The remaining parameters name other tasks on
 *   which the task is dependent, and the results from those tasks are the
 *   arguments of those parameters.
 * @param {Function} [callback] - An optional callback which is called when all
 * the tasks have been completed. It receives the `err` argument if any `tasks`
 * pass an error to their callback, and a `results` object with any completed
 * task results, similar to `auto`.
 * @example
 *
 * //  The example from `auto` can be rewritten as follows:
 * async.autoInject({
 *     get_data: function(callback) {
 *         // async code to get some data
 *         callback(null, 'data', 'converted to array');
 *     },
 *     make_folder: function(callback) {
 *         // async code to create a directory to store a file in
 *         // this is run at the same time as getting the data
 *         callback(null, 'folder');
 *     },
 *     write_file: function(get_data, make_folder, callback) {
 *         // once there is some data and the directory exists,
 *         // write the data to a file in the directory
 *         callback(null, 'filename');
 *     },
 *     email_link: function(write_file, callback) {
 *         // once the file is written let's email a link to it...
 *         // write_file contains the filename returned by write_file.
 *         callback(null, {'file':write_file, 'email':'user@example.com'});
 *     }
 * }, function(err, results) {
 *     console.log('err = ', err);
 *     console.log('email_link = ', results.email_link);
 * });
 *
 * // If you are using a JS minifier that mangles parameter names, `autoInject`
 * // will not work with plain functions, since the parameter names will be
 * // collapsed to a single letter identifier.  To work around this, you can
 * // explicitly specify the names of the parameters your task function needs
 * // in an array, similar to Angular.js dependency injection.
 *
 * // This still has an advantage over plain `auto`, since the results a task
 * // depends on are still spread into arguments.
 * async.autoInject({
 *     //...
 *     write_file: ['get_data', 'make_folder', function(get_data, make_folder, callback) {
 *         callback(null, 'filename');
 *     }],

/**
 * An "async function" in the context of Async is an asynchronous function with
 * a variable number of parameters, with the final parameter being a callback.
 * (`function (arg1, arg2, ..., callback) {}`)
 * The final callback is of the form `callback(err, results...)`, which must be
 * called once the function is completed.  The callback should be called with a
 * Error as its first argument to signal that an error occurred.
 * Otherwise, if no error occurred, it should be called with `null` as the first
 * argument, and any additional `result` arguments that may apply, to signal
 * successful completion.
 * The callback must be called exactly once, ideally on a later tick of the
 * JavaScript event loop.
 *
 * This type of function is also referred to as a "Node-style async function",
 * or a "continuation passing-style function" (CPS). Most of the methods of this
 * library are themselves CPS/Node-style async functions, or functions that
 * return CPS/Node-style async functions.
 *
 * Wherever we accept a Node-style async function, we also directly accept an
 * [ES2017 `async` function]{@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function}.
 * In this case, the `async` function will not be passed a final callback
 * argument, and any thrown error will be used as the `err` argument of the
 * implicit callback, and the return value will be used as the `result` value.
 * (i.e. a `rejected` of the returned Promise becomes the `err` callback
 * argument, and a `resolved` value becomes the `result`.)
 *
 * Note, due to JavaScript limitations, we can only detect native `async`
 * functions and not transpilied implementations.
 * Your environment must have `async`/`await` support for this to work.
 * (e.g. Node > v7.6, or a recent version of a modern browser).
 * If you are using `async` functions through a transpiler (e.g. Babel), you
 * must still wrap the function with [asyncify]{@link module:Utils.asyncify},
 * because the `async function` will be compiled to an ordinary function that
 * returns a promise.

// a transform stream is a readable/writable stream where you do
// something with the data.  Sometimes it's called a "filter",
// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where
// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would
// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)
//
// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a
// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,
// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then
// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.
//
// Here's how this works:
//
// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable
// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)
// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes
// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until
// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.
//
// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When
// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the
// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single
// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first
// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into
// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.
//
// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,
// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,
// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering
// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is
// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many
// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in
// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small
// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In
// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell
// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could
// cause the system to run out of memory.
//
// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk
// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until
// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.

/**
 * Performs initialization, ie: precomputes tables to optimize for speed.
 *
 * One way to understand how AES works is to imagine that 'addition' and
 * 'multiplication' are interfaces that require certain mathematical
 * properties to hold true (ie: they are associative) but they might have
 * different implementations and produce different kinds of results ...
 * provided that their mathematical properties remain true. AES defines
 * its own methods of addition and multiplication but keeps some important
 * properties the same, ie: associativity and distributivity. The
 * explanation below tries to shed some light on how AES defines addition
 * and multiplication of bytes and 32-bit words in order to perform its
 * encryption and decryption algorithms.
 *
 * The basics:
 *
 * The AES algorithm views bytes as binary representations of polynomials
 * that have either 1 or 0 as the coefficients. It defines the addition
 * or subtraction of two bytes as the XOR operation. It also defines the
 * multiplication of two bytes as a finite field referred to as GF(2^8)
 * (Note: 'GF' means "Galois Field" which is a field that contains a finite
 * number of elements so GF(2^8) has 256 elements).
 *
 * This means that any two bytes can be represented as binary polynomials;
 * when they multiplied together and modularly reduced by an irreducible
 * polynomial of the 8th degree, the results are the field GF(2^8). The
 * specific irreducible polynomial that AES uses in hexadecimal is 0x11b.
 * This multiplication is associative with 0x01 as the identity:
 *
 * (b * 0x01 = GF(b, 0x01) = b).
 *
 * The operation GF(b, 0x02) can be performed at the byte level by left
 * shifting b once and then XOR'ing it (to perform the modular reduction)
 * with 0x11b if b is >= 128. Repeated application of the multiplication
 * of 0x02 can be used to implement the multiplication of any two bytes.
 *
 * For instance, multiplying 0x57 and 0x13, denoted as GF(0x57, 0x13), can
 * be performed by factoring 0x13 into 0x01, 0x02, and 0x10. Then these
 * factors can each be multiplied by 0x57 and then added together. To do
 * the multiplication, values for 0x57 multiplied by each of these 3 factors
 * can be precomputed and stored in a table. To add them, the values from
 * the table are XOR'd together.
 *
 * AES also defines addition and multiplication of words, that is 4-byte
 * numbers represented as polynomials of 3 degrees where the coefficients
 * are the values of the bytes.
 *
 * The word [a0, a1, a2, a3] is a polynomial a3x^3 + a2x^2 + a1x + a0.
 *
 * Addition is performed by XOR'ing like powers of x. Multiplication
 * is performed in two steps, the first is an algebriac expansion as
 * you would do normally (where addition is XOR). But the result is
 * a polynomial larger than 3 degrees and thus it cannot fit in a word. So
 * next the result is modularly reduced by an AES-specific polynomial of
 * degree 4 which will always produce a polynomial of less than 4 degrees
 * such that it will fit in a word. In AES, this polynomial is x^4 + 1.
 *
 * The modular product of two polynomials 'a' and 'b' is thus:
 *
 * d(x) = d3x^3 + d2x^2 + d1x + d0
 * with
 * d0 = GF(a0, b0) ^ GF(a3, b1) ^ GF(a2, b2) ^ GF(a1, b3)
 * d1 = GF(a1, b0) ^ GF(a0, b1) ^ GF(a3, b2) ^ GF(a2, b3)
 * d2 = GF(a2, b0) ^ GF(a1, b1) ^ GF(a0, b2) ^ GF(a3, b3)
 * d3 = GF(a3, b0) ^ GF(a2, b1) ^ GF(a1, b2) ^ GF(a0, b3)
 *
 * As a matrix:
 *
 * [d0] = [a0 a3 a2 a1][b0]
 * [d1]   [a1 a0 a3 a2][b1]
 * [d2]   [a2 a1 a0 a3][b2]
 * [d3]   [a3 a2 a1 a0][b3]
 *
 * Special polynomials defined by AES (0x02 == {02}):
 * a(x)    = {03}x^3 + {01}x^2 + {01}x + {02}
 * a^-1(x) = {0b}x^3 + {0d}x^2 + {09}x + {0e}.
 *
 * These polynomials are used in the MixColumns() and InverseMixColumns()
 * operations, respectively, to cause each element in the state to affect
 * the output (referred to as diffusing).
 *
 * RotWord() uses: a0 = a1 = a2 = {00} and a3 = {01}, which is the
 * polynomial x3.
 *
 * The ShiftRows() method modifies the last 3 rows in the state (where
 * the state is 4 words with 4 bytes per word) by shifting bytes cyclically.
 * The 1st byte in the second row is moved to the end of the row. The 1st
 * and 2nd bytes in the third row are moved to the end of the row. The 1st,
 * 2nd, and 3rd bytes are moved in the fourth row.
 *
 * More details on how AES arithmetic works:
 *
 * In the polynomial representation of binary numbers, XOR performs addition
 * and subtraction and multiplication in GF(2^8) denoted as GF(a, b)
 * corresponds with the multiplication of polynomials modulo an irreducible
 * polynomial of degree 8. In other words, for AES, GF(a, b) will multiply
 * polynomial 'a' with polynomial 'b' and then do a modular reduction by
 * an AES-specific irreducible polynomial of degree 8.
 *
 * A polynomial is irreducible if its only divisors are one and itself. For
 * the AES algorithm, this irreducible polynomial is:
 *
 * m(x) = x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1,
 *
 * or {01}{1b} in hexadecimal notation, where each coefficient is a bit:
 * 100011011 = 283 = 0x11b.
 *
 * For example, GF(0x57, 0x83) = 0xc1 because
 *
 * 0x57 = 87  = 01010111 = x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1
 * 0x85 = 131 = 10000101 = x^7 + x + 1
 *
 * (x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1) * (x^7 + x + 1)
 * =  x^13 + x^11 + x^9 + x^8 + x^7 +
 *    x^7 + x^5 + x^3 + x^2 + x +
 *    x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1
 * =  x^13 + x^11 + x^9 + x^8 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + 1 = y
 *    y modulo (x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1)
 * =  x^7 + x^6 + 1.
 *
 * The modular reduction by m(x) guarantees the result will be a binary
 * polynomial of less than degree 8, so that it can fit in a byte.
 *
 * The operation to multiply a binary polynomial b with x (the polynomial
 * x in binary representation is 00000010) is:
 *
 * b_7x^8 + b_6x^7 + b_5x^6 + b_4x^5 + b_3x^4 + b_2x^3 + b_1x^2 + b_0x^1
 *
 * To get GF(b, x) we must reduce that by m(x). If b_7 is 0 (that is the
 * most significant bit is 0 in b) then the result is already reduced. If
 * it is 1, then we can reduce it by subtracting m(x) via an XOR.
 *
 * It follows that multiplication by x (00000010 or 0x02) can be implemented
 * by performing a left shift followed by a conditional bitwise XOR with
 * 0x1b. This operation on bytes is denoted by xtime(). Multiplication by
 * higher powers of x can be implemented by repeated application of xtime().
 *
 * By adding intermediate results, multiplication by any constant can be
 * implemented. For instance:
 *
 * GF(0x57, 0x13) = 0xfe because:
 *
 * xtime(b) = (b & 128) ? (b << 1 ^ 0x11b) : (b << 1)
 *
 * Note: We XOR with 0x11b instead of 0x1b because in javascript our
 * datatype for b can be larger than 1 byte, so a left shift will not
 * automatically eliminate bits that overflow a byte ... by XOR'ing the
 * overflow bit with 1 (the extra one from 0x11b) we zero it out.
 *
 * GF(0x57, 0x02) = xtime(0x57) = 0xae
 * GF(0x57, 0x04) = xtime(0xae) = 0x47
 * GF(0x57, 0x08) = xtime(0x47) = 0x8e
 * GF(0x57, 0x10) = xtime(0x8e) = 0x07
 *
 * GF(0x57, 0x13) = GF(0x57, (0x01 ^ 0x02 ^ 0x10))
 *
 * And by the distributive property (since XOR is addition and GF() is
 * multiplication):
 *
 * = GF(0x57, 0x01) ^ GF(0x57, 0x02) ^ GF(0x57, 0x10)
 * = 0x57 ^ 0xae ^ 0x07
 * = 0xfe.

      all of the elements in GF, find their multiplicative inverses,
      and apply to each the following affine transformation:

      bi' = bi ^ b(i + 4) mod 8 ^ b(i + 5) mod 8 ^ b(i + 6) mod 8 ^
            b(i + 7) mod 8 ^ ci
      for 0 <= i < 8, where bi is the ith bit of the byte, and ci is the
      ith bit of a byte c with the value {63} or {01100011}.

      It is possible to traverse every possible value in a Galois field
      using what is referred to as a 'generator'. There are many
      generators (128 out of 256): 3,5,6,9,11,82 to name a few. To fully
      traverse GF we iterate 255 times, multiplying by our generator
      each time.

      On each iteration we can determine the multiplicative inverse for
      the current element.

      Suppose there is an element in GF 'e'. For a given generator 'g',
      e = g^x. The multiplicative inverse of e is g^(255 - x). It turns
      out that if use the inverse of a generator as another generator
      it will produce all of the corresponding multiplicative inverses
      at the same time. For this reason, we choose 5 as our inverse
      generator because it only requires 2 multiplies and 1 add and its
      inverse, 82, requires relatively few operations as well.

      In order to apply the affine transformation, the multiplicative
      inverse 'ei' of 'e' can be repeatedly XOR'd (4 times) with a
      bit-cycling of 'ei'. To do this 'ei' is first stored in 's' and
      'x'. Then 's' is left shifted and the high bit of 's' is made the
      low bit. The resulting value is stored in 's'. Then 'x' is XOR'd
      with 's' and stored in 'x'. On each subsequent iteration the same
      operation is performed. When 4 iterations are complete, 'x' is
      XOR'd with 'c' (0x63) and the transformed value is stored in 'x'.
      For example:

      s = 01000001
      x = 01000001

      iteration 1: s = 10000010, x ^= s
      iteration 2: s = 00000101, x ^= s
      iteration 3: s = 00001010, x ^= s
      iteration 4: s = 00010100, x ^= s
      x ^= 0x63

      This can be done with a loop where s = (s << 1) | (s >> 7). However,
      it can also be done by using a single 16-bit (in this case 32-bit)
      number 'sx'. Since XOR is an associative operation, we can set 'sx'
      to 'ei' and then XOR it with 'sx' left-shifted 1,2,3, and 4 times.
      The most significant bits will flow into the high 8 bit positions
      and be correctly XOR'd with one another. All that remains will be
      to cycle the high 8 bits by XOR'ing them all with the lower 8 bits
      afterwards.

      At the same time we're populating sbox and isbox we can precompute
      the multiplication we'll need to do to do MixColumns() later.

      [1 2 3 1] [r1,c] [r'1,c]
      [1 1 2 3] [r2,c] [r'2,c]
      [3 1 1 2] [r3,c] [r'3,c]

      r0, r1, r2, and r3 are each 1 byte of one of the words in the
      state (a column). To do matrix multiplication for each mixed
      column c' we multiply the corresponding row from the left matrix
      with the corresponding column from the right matrix. In total, we
      get 4 equations:

      r0,c' = 2*r0,c + 3*r1,c + 1*r2,c + 1*r3,c
      r1,c' = 1*r0,c + 2*r1,c + 3*r2,c + 1*r3,c
      r2,c' = 1*r0,c + 1*r1,c + 2*r2,c + 3*r3,c
      r3,c' = 3*r0,c + 1*r1,c + 1*r2,c + 2*r3,c

      As usual, the multiplication is as previously defined and the
      addition is XOR. In order to optimize mixing columns we can store
      the multiplication results in tables. If you think of the whole
      column as a word (it might help to visualize by mentally rotating
      the equations above by counterclockwise 90 degrees) then you can
      see that it would be useful to map the multiplications performed on
      each byte (r0, r1, r2, r3) onto a word as well. For instance, we
      could map 2*r0,1*r0,1*r0,3*r0 onto a word by storing 2*r0 in the
      highest 8 bits and 3*r0 in the lowest 8 bits (with the other two
      respectively in the middle). This means that a table can be
      constructed that uses r0 as an index to the word. We can do the
      same with r1, r2, and r3, creating a total of 4 tables.

      To construct a full c', we can just look up each byte of c in
      their respective tables and XOR the results together.

      Also, to build each table we only have to calculate the word
      for 2,1,1,3 for every byte ... which we can do on each iteration
      of this loop since we will iterate over every byte. After we have
      calculated 2,1,1,3 we can get the results for the other tables
      by cycling the byte at the end to the beginning. For instance
      we can take the result of table 2,1,1,3 and produce table 3,2,1,1
      by moving the right most byte to the left most position just like
      how you can imagine the 3 moved out of 2,1,1,3 and to the front
      to produce 3,2,1,1.

      There is another optimization in that the same multiples of
      the current element we need in order to advance our generator
      to the next iteration can be reused in performing the 2,1,1,3
      calculation. We also calculate the inverse mix column tables,
      with e,9,d,b being the inverse of 2,1,1,3.

      When we're done, and we need to actually mix columns, the first
      byte of each state word should be put through mix[0] (2,1,1,3),
      the second through mix[1] (3,2,1,1) and so forth. Then they should
      be XOR'd together to produce the fully mixed column.

  /* When we are updating a cipher block we always use the code path for
     encryption whether we are decrypting or not (to shorten code and
     simplify the generation of look up tables). However, because there
     are differences in the decryption algorithm, other than just swapping
     in different look up tables, we must transform our key schedule to
     account for these changes:

     1. The decryption algorithm gets its key rounds in reverse order.
     2. The decryption algorithm adds the round key before mixing columns
       instead of afterwards.

     We don't need to modify our key schedule to handle the first case,
     we can just traverse the key schedule in reverse order when decrypting.

     The second case requires a little work.

     The tables we built for performing rounds will take an input and then
     perform SubBytes() and MixColumns() or, for the decrypt version,
     InvSubBytes() and InvMixColumns(). But the decrypt algorithm requires
     us to AddRoundKey() before InvMixColumns(). This means we'll need to
     apply some transformations to the round key to inverse-mix its columns
     so they'll be correct for moving AddRoundKey() to after the state has
     had its columns inverse-mixed.

     To inverse-mix the columns of the state when we're decrypting we use a
     lookup table that will apply InvSubBytes() and InvMixColumns() at the
     same time. However, the round key's bytes are not inverse-substituted
     in the decryption algorithm. To get around this problem, we can first
     substitute the bytes in the round key so that when we apply the
     transformation via the InvSubBytes()+InvMixColumns() table, it will
     undo our substitution leaving us with the original value that we
     want -- and then inverse-mix that value.

     This change will correctly alter our key schedule so that we can XOR
     each round key with our already transformed decryption state. This
     allows us to use the same code path as the encryption algorithm.

     We make one more change to the decryption key. Since the decryption
     algorithm runs in reverse from the encryption algorithm, we reverse
     the order of the round keys to avoid having to iterate over the key
     schedule backwards when running the encryption algorithm later in
     decryption mode. In addition to reversing the order of the round keys,
     we also swap each round key's 2nd and 4th rows. See the comments
     section where rounds are performed for more details about why this is
     done. These changes are done inline with the other substitution
     described above.

  for(var round = 1; round < Nr; ++round) {
    /* As described above, we'll be using table lookups to perform the
      column mixing. Each column is stored as a word in the state (the
      array 'input' has one column as a word at each index). In order to
      mix a column, we perform these transformations on each row in c,
      which is 1 byte in each word. The new column for c0 is c'0:

               m0      m1      m2      m3
      r0,c'0 = 2*r0,c0 + 3*r1,c0 + 1*r2,c0 + 1*r3,c0
      r1,c'0 = 1*r0,c0 + 2*r1,c0 + 3*r2,c0 + 1*r3,c0
      r2,c'0 = 1*r0,c0 + 1*r1,c0 + 2*r2,c0 + 3*r3,c0
      r3,c'0 = 3*r0,c0 + 1*r1,c0 + 1*r2,c0 + 2*r3,c0

      So using mix tables where c0 is a word with r0 being its upper
      8 bits and r3 being its lower 8 bits:

      m0[c0 >> 24] will yield this word: [2*r0,1*r0,1*r0,3*r0]
      ...
      m3[c0 & 255] will yield this word: [1*r3,1*r3,3*r3,2*r3]

      Therefore to mix the columns in each word in the state we
      do the following (& 255 omitted for brevity):
      c'0,r0 = m0[c0 >> 24] ^ m1[c1 >> 16] ^ m2[c2 >> 8] ^ m3[c3]
      c'0,r1 = m0[c0 >> 24] ^ m1[c1 >> 16] ^ m2[c2 >> 8] ^ m3[c3]
      c'0,r2 = m0[c0 >> 24] ^ m1[c1 >> 16] ^ m2[c2 >> 8] ^ m3[c3]
      c'0,r3 = m0[c0 >> 24] ^ m1[c1 >> 16] ^ m2[c2 >> 8] ^ m3[c3]

      However, before mixing, the algorithm requires us to perform
      ShiftRows(). The ShiftRows() transformation cyclically shifts the
      last 3 rows of the state over different offsets. The first row
      (r = 0) is not shifted.

      s'_r,c = s_r,(c + shift(r, Nb) mod Nb
      for 0 < r < 4 and 0 <= c < Nb and
      shift(1, 4) = 1
      shift(2, 4) = 2
      shift(3, 4) = 3.

      This causes the first byte in r = 1 to be moved to the end of
      the row, the first 2 bytes in r = 2 to be moved to the end of
      the row, the first 3 bytes in r = 3 to be moved to the end of
      the row:

      r1: [c0 c1 c2 c3] => [c1 c2 c3 c0]
      r2: [c0 c1 c2 c3]    [c2 c3 c0 c1]
      r3: [c0 c1 c2 c3]    [c3 c0 c1 c2]

      We can make these substitutions inline with our column mixing to
      generate an updated set of equations to produce each word in the
      state (note the columns have changed positions):

      c0 c1 c2 c3 => c0 c1 c2 c3
      c0 c1 c2 c3    c1 c2 c3 c0  (cycled 1 byte)
      c0 c1 c2 c3    c2 c3 c0 c1  (cycled 2 bytes)
      c0 c1 c2 c3    c3 c0 c1 c2  (cycled 3 bytes)

      Therefore:

      c'0 = 2*r0,c0 + 3*r1,c1 + 1*r2,c2 + 1*r3,c3
      c'0 = 1*r0,c0 + 2*r1,c1 + 3*r2,c2 + 1*r3,c3
      c'0 = 1*r0,c0 + 1*r1,c1 + 2*r2,c2 + 3*r3,c3
      c'0 = 3*r0,c0 + 1*r1,c1 + 1*r2,c2 + 2*r3,c3

      c'1 = 2*r0,c1 + 3*r1,c2 + 1*r2,c3 + 1*r3,c0
      c'1 = 1*r0,c1 + 2*r1,c2 + 3*r2,c3 + 1*r3,c0
      c'1 = 1*r0,c1 + 1*r1,c2 + 2*r2,c3 + 3*r3,c0
      c'1 = 3*r0,c1 + 1*r1,c2 + 1*r2,c3 + 2*r3,c0

      ... and so forth for c'2 and c'3. The important distinction is
      that the columns are cycling, with c0 being used with the m0
      map when calculating c0, but c1 being used with the m0 map when
      calculating c1 ... and so forth.

      When performing the inverse we transform the mirror image and
      skip the bottom row, instead of the top one, and move upwards:

      c3 c2 c1 c0 => c0 c3 c2 c1  (cycled 3 bytes) *same as encryption
      c3 c2 c1 c0    c1 c0 c3 c2  (cycled 2 bytes)
      c3 c2 c1 c0    c2 c1 c0 c3  (cycled 1 byte)  *same as encryption
      c3 c2 c1 c0    c3 c2 c1 c0

      If you compare the resulting matrices for ShiftRows()+MixColumns()
      and for InvShiftRows()+InvMixColumns() the 2nd and 4th columns are
      different (in encrypt mode vs. decrypt mode). So in order to use
      the same code to handle both encryption and decryption, we will
      need to do some mapping.

      If in encryption mode we let a=c0, b=c1, c=c2, d=c3, and r<N> be
      a row number in the state, then the resulting matrix in encryption
      mode for applying the above transformations would be:

      r1: a b c d
      r2: b c d a
      r3: c d a b
      r4: d a b c

      If we did the same in decryption mode we would get:

      r1: a d c b
      r2: b a d c
      r3: c b a d
      r4: d c b a

      If instead we swap d and b (set b=c3 and d=c1), then we get:

      r1: a b c d
      r2: d a b c
      r3: c d a b
      r4: b c d a

      Now the 1st and 3rd rows are the same as the encryption matrix. All
      we need to do then to make the mapping exactly the same is to swap
      the 2nd and 4th rows when in decryption mode. To do this without
      having to do it on each iteration, we swapped the 2nd and 4th rows
      in the decryption key schedule. We also have to do the swap above
      when we first pull in the input and when we set the final output. */

/**
 * Javascript implementation of Abstract Syntax Notation Number One.
 *
 * @author Dave Longley
 *
 * Copyright (c) 2010-2015 Digital Bazaar, Inc.
 *
 * An API for storing data using the Abstract Syntax Notation Number One
 * format using DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoding. This encoding is
 * commonly used to store data for PKI, i.e. X.509 Certificates, and this
 * implementation exists for that purpose.
 *
 * Abstract Syntax Notation Number One (ASN.1) is used to define the abstract
 * syntax of information without restricting the way the information is encoded
 * for transmission. It provides a standard that allows for open systems
 * communication. ASN.1 defines the syntax of information data and a number of
 * simple data types as well as a notation for describing them and specifying
 * values for them.
 *
 * The RSA algorithm creates public and private keys that are often stored in
 * X.509 or PKCS#X formats -- which use ASN.1 (encoded in DER format). This
 * class provides the most basic functionality required to store and load DSA
 * keys that are encoded according to ASN.1.
 *
 * The most common binary encodings for ASN.1 are BER (Basic Encoding Rules)
 * and DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules). DER is just a subset of BER that
 * has stricter requirements for how data must be encoded.
 *
 * Each ASN.1 structure has a tag (a byte identifying the ASN.1 structure type)
 * and a byte array for the value of this ASN1 structure which may be data or a
 * list of ASN.1 structures.
 *
 * Each ASN.1 structure using BER is (Tag-Length-Value):
 *
 * | byte 0 | bytes X | bytes Y |
 * |--------|---------|----------
 * |  tag   | length  |  value  |
 *
 * ASN.1 allows for tags to be of "High-tag-number form" which allows a tag to
 * be two or more octets, but that is not supported by this class. A tag is
 * only 1 byte. Bits 1-5 give the tag number (ie the data type within a
 * particular 'class'), 6 indicates whether or not the ASN.1 value is
 * constructed from other ASN.1 values, and bits 7 and 8 give the 'class'. If
 * bits 7 and 8 are both zero, the class is UNIVERSAL. If only bit 7 is set,
 * then the class is APPLICATION. If only bit 8 is set, then the class is
 * CONTEXT_SPECIFIC. If both bits 7 and 8 are set, then the class is PRIVATE.
 * The tag numbers for the data types for the class UNIVERSAL are listed below:
 *
 * UNIVERSAL 0 Reserved for use by the encoding rules
 * UNIVERSAL 1 Boolean type
 * UNIVERSAL 2 Integer type
 * UNIVERSAL 3 Bitstring type
 * UNIVERSAL 4 Octetstring type
 * UNIVERSAL 5 Null type
 * UNIVERSAL 6 Object identifier type
 * UNIVERSAL 7 Object descriptor type
 * UNIVERSAL 8 External type and Instance-of type
 * UNIVERSAL 9 Real type
 * UNIVERSAL 10 Enumerated type
 * UNIVERSAL 11 Embedded-pdv type
 * UNIVERSAL 12 UTF8String type
 * UNIVERSAL 13 Relative object identifier type
 * UNIVERSAL 14-15 Reserved for future editions
 * UNIVERSAL 16 Sequence and Sequence-of types
 * UNIVERSAL 17 Set and Set-of types
 * UNIVERSAL 18-22, 25-30 Character string types
 * UNIVERSAL 23-24 Time types
 *
 * The length of an ASN.1 structure is specified after the tag identifier.
 * There is a definite form and an indefinite form. The indefinite form may
 * be used if the encoding is constructed and not all immediately available.
 * The indefinite form is encoded using a length byte with only the 8th bit
 * set. The end of the constructed object is marked using end-of-contents
 * octets (two zero bytes).
 *
 * The definite form looks like this:
 *
 * The length may take up 1 or more bytes, it depends on the length of the
 * value of the ASN.1 structure. DER encoding requires that if the ASN.1
 * structure has a value that has a length greater than 127, more than 1 byte
 * will be used to store its length, otherwise just one byte will be used.
 * This is strict.
 *
 * In the case that the length of the ASN.1 value is less than 127, 1 octet
 * (byte) is used to store the "short form" length. The 8th bit has a value of
 * 0 indicating the length is "short form" and not "long form" and bits 7-1
 * give the length of the data. (The 8th bit is the left-most, most significant
 * bit: also known as big endian or network format).
 *
 * In the case that the length of the ASN.1 value is greater than 127, 2 to
 * 127 octets (bytes) are used to store the "long form" length. The first
 * byte's 8th bit is set to 1 to indicate the length is "long form." Bits 7-1
 * give the number of additional octets. All following octets are in base 256
 * with the most significant digit first (typical big-endian binary unsigned
 * integer storage). So, for instance, if the length of a value was 257, the
 * first byte would be set to:
 *
 * 10000010 = 130 = 0x82.
 *
 * This indicates there are 2 octets (base 256) for the length. The second and
 * third bytes (the octets just mentioned) would store the length in base 256:
 *
 * octet 2: 00000001 = 1 * 256^1 = 256
 * octet 3: 00000001 = 1 * 256^0 = 1
 * total = 257
 *
 * The algorithm for converting a js integer value of 257 to base-256 is:
 *
 * var value = 257;
 * var bytes = [];
 * bytes[0] = (value >>> 8) & 0xFF; // most significant byte first
 * bytes[1] = value & 0xFF;        // least significant byte last
 *
 * On the ASN.1 UNIVERSAL Object Identifier (OID) type:
 *
 * An OID can be written like: "value1.value2.value3...valueN"
 *
 * The DER encoding rules:
 *
 * The first byte has the value 40 * value1 + value2.
 * The following bytes, if any, encode the remaining values. Each value is
 * encoded in base 128, most significant digit first (big endian), with as
 * few digits as possible, and the most significant bit of each byte set
 * to 1 except the last in each value's encoding. For example: Given the
 * OID "1.2.840.113549", its DER encoding is (remember each byte except the
 * last one in each encoding is OR'd with 0x80):
 *
 * byte 1: 40 * 1 + 2 = 42 = 0x2A.
 * bytes 2-3: 128 * 6 + 72 = 840 = 6 72 = 6 72 = 0x0648 = 0x8648
 * bytes 4-6: 16384 * 6 + 128 * 119 + 13 = 6 119 13 = 0x06770D = 0x86F70D
 *
 * The final value is: 0x2A864886F70D.
 * The full OID (including ASN.1 tag and length of 6 bytes) is:
 * 0x06062A864886F70D

/**
 * See NIST SP-800-38D 6.3 (Algorithm 1). This function performs Galois
 * field multiplication. The field, GF(2^128), is defined by the polynomial:
 *
 * x^128 + x^7 + x^2 + x + 1
 *
 * Which is represented in little-endian binary form as: 11100001 (0xe1). When
 * the value of a coefficient is 1, a bit is set. The value R, is the
 * concatenation of this value and 120 zero bits, yielding a 128-bit value
 * which matches the block size.
 *
 * This function will multiply two elements (vectors of bytes), X and Y, in
 * the field GF(2^128). The result is initialized to zero. For each bit of
 * X (out of 128), x_i, if x_i is set, then the result is multiplied (XOR'd)
 * by the current value of Y. For each bit, the value of Y will be raised by
 * a power of x (multiplied by the polynomial x). This can be achieved by
 * shifting Y once to the right. If the current value of Y, prior to being
 * multiplied by x, has 0 as its LSB, then it is a 127th degree polynomial.
 * Otherwise, we must divide by R after shifting to find the remainder.
 *

  /* Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) states:

    Suppose n1, n2, ..., nk are positive integers which are pairwise
    coprime (n1 and n2 have no common factors other than 1). For any
    integers x1, x2, ..., xk there exists an integer x solving the
    system of simultaneous congruences (where ~= means modularly
    congruent so a ~= b mod n means a mod n = b mod n):

    x ~= x1 mod n1
    x ~= x2 mod n2
    ...
    x ~= xk mod nk

    This system of congruences has a single simultaneous solution x
    between 0 and n - 1. Furthermore, each xk solution and x itself
    is congruent modulo the product n = n1*n2*...*nk.
    So x1 mod n = x2 mod n = xk mod n = x mod n.

    The single simultaneous solution x can be solved with the following
    equation:

    x = sum(xi*ri*si) mod n where ri = n/ni and si = ri^-1 mod ni.

    Where x is less than n, xi = x mod ni.

    For RSA we are only concerned with k = 2. The modulus n = pq, where
    p and q are coprime. The RSA decryption algorithm is:

    y = x^d mod n

    Given the above:

    x1 = x^d mod p
    r1 = n/p = q
    s1 = q^-1 mod p
    x2 = x^d mod q
    r2 = n/q = p
    s2 = p^-1 mod q

    So y = (x1r1s1 + x2r2s2) mod n
         = ((x^d mod p)q(q^-1 mod p) + (x^d mod q)p(p^-1 mod q)) mod n

    According to Fermat's Little Theorem, if the modulus P is prime,
    for any integer A not evenly divisible by P, A^(P-1) ~= 1 mod P.
    Since A is not divisible by P it follows that if:
    N ~= M mod (P - 1), then A^N mod P = A^M mod P. Therefore:

    A^N mod P = A^(M mod (P - 1)) mod P. (The latter takes less effort
    to calculate). In order to calculate x^d mod p more quickly the
    exponent d mod (p - 1) is stored in the RSA private key (the same
    is done for x^d mod q). These values are referred to as dP and dQ
    respectively. Therefore we now have:

    y = ((x^dP mod p)q(q^-1 mod p) + (x^dQ mod q)p(p^-1 mod q)) mod n

    Since we'll be reducing x^dP by modulo p (same for q) we can also
    reduce x by p (and q respectively) before hand. Therefore, let

    xp = ((x mod p)^dP mod p), and
    xq = ((x mod q)^dQ mod q), yielding:

    y = (xp*q*(q^-1 mod p) + xq*p*(p^-1 mod q)) mod n

    This can be further reduced to a simple algorithm that only
    requires 1 inverse (the q inverse is used) to be used and stored.
    The algorithm is called Garner's algorithm. If qInv is the
    inverse of q, we simply calculate:

    y = (qInv*(xp - xq) mod p) * q + xq

    However, there are two further complications. First, we need to
    ensure that xp > xq to prevent signed BigIntegers from being used
    so we add p until this is true (since we will be mod'ing with
    p anyway). Then, there is a known timing attack on algorithms
    using the CRT. To mitigate this risk, "cryptographic blinding"
    should be used. This requires simply generating a random number r
    between 0 and n-1 and its inverse and multiplying x by r^e before
    calculating y and then multiplying y by r^-1 afterwards. Note that
    r must be coprime with n (gcd(r, n) === 1) in order to have an
    inverse.

  var xp = x.mod(key.p).modPow(key.dP, key.p);

/**
 * A Javascript implementation of Transport Layer Security (TLS).
 *
 * @author Dave Longley
 *
 * Copyright (c) 2009-2014 Digital Bazaar, Inc.
 *
 * The TLS Handshake Protocol involves the following steps:
 *
 * - Exchange hello messages to agree on algorithms, exchange random values,
 * and check for session resumption.
 *
 * - Exchange the necessary cryptographic parameters to allow the client and
 * server to agree on a premaster secret.
 *
 * - Exchange certificates and cryptographic information to allow the client
 * and server to authenticate themselves.
 *
 * - Generate a master secret from the premaster secret and exchanged random
 * values.
 *
 * - Provide security parameters to the record layer.
 *
 * - Allow the client and server to verify that their peer has calculated the
 * same security parameters and that the handshake occurred without tampering
 * by an attacker.
 *
 * Up to 4 different messages may be sent during a key exchange. The server
 * certificate, the server key exchange, the client certificate, and the
 * client key exchange.
 *
 * A typical handshake (from the client's perspective).
 *
 * 1. Client sends ClientHello.
 * 2. Client receives ServerHello.
 * 3. Client receives optional Certificate.
 * 4. Client receives optional ServerKeyExchange.
 * 5. Client receives ServerHelloDone.
 * 6. Client sends optional Certificate.
 * 7. Client sends ClientKeyExchange.
 * 8. Client sends optional CertificateVerify.
 * 9. Client sends ChangeCipherSpec.
 * 10. Client sends Finished.
 * 11. Client receives ChangeCipherSpec.
 * 12. Client receives Finished.
 * 13. Client sends/receives application data.
 *
 * To reuse an existing session:
 *
 * 1. Client sends ClientHello with session ID for reuse.
 * 2. Client receives ServerHello with same session ID if reusing.
 * 3. Client receives ChangeCipherSpec message if reusing.
 * 4. Client receives Finished.
 * 5. Client sends ChangeCipherSpec.
 * 6. Client sends Finished.
 *
 * Note: Client ignores HelloRequest if in the middle of a handshake.
 *
 * Record Layer:
 *
 * The record layer fragments information blocks into TLSPlaintext records
 * carrying data in chunks of 2^14 bytes or less. Client message boundaries are
 * not preserved in the record layer (i.e., multiple client messages of the
 * same ContentType MAY be coalesced into a single TLSPlaintext record, or a
 * single message MAY be fragmented across several records).
 *
 * struct {
 *   uint8 major;
 *   uint8 minor;
 * } ProtocolVersion;
 *
 * struct {
 *   ContentType type;
 *   ProtocolVersion version;
 *   uint16 length;
 *   opaque fragment[TLSPlaintext.length];
 * } TLSPlaintext;
 *
 * type:
 *   The higher-level protocol used to process the enclosed fragment.
 *
 * version:
 *   The version of the protocol being employed. TLS Version 1.2 uses version
 *   {3, 3}. TLS Version 1.0 uses version {3, 1}. Note that a client that
 *   supports multiple versions of TLS may not know what version will be
 *   employed before it receives the ServerHello.
 *
 * length:
 *   The length (in bytes) of the following TLSPlaintext.fragment. The length
 *   MUST NOT exceed 2^14 = 16384 bytes.
 *
 * fragment:
 *   The application data. This data is transparent and treated as an
 *   independent block to be dealt with by the higher-level protocol specified
 *   by the type field.
 *
 * Implementations MUST NOT send zero-length fragments of Handshake, Alert, or
 * ChangeCipherSpec content types. Zero-length fragments of Application data
 * MAY be sent as they are potentially useful as a traffic analysis
 * countermeasure.
 *
 * Note: Data of different TLS record layer content types MAY be interleaved.
 * Application data is generally of lower precedence for transmission than
 * other content types. However, records MUST be delivered to the network in
 * the same order as they are protected by the record layer. Recipients MUST
 * receive and process interleaved application layer traffic during handshakes
 * subsequent to the first one on a connection.
 *
 * struct {
 *   ContentType type;       // same as TLSPlaintext.type
 *   ProtocolVersion version;// same as TLSPlaintext.version
 *   uint16 length;
 *   opaque fragment[TLSCompressed.length];
 * } TLSCompressed;
 *
 * length:
 *   The length (in bytes) of the following TLSCompressed.fragment.
 *   The length MUST NOT exceed 2^14 + 1024.
 *
 * fragment:
 *   The compressed form of TLSPlaintext.fragment.
 *
 * Note: A CompressionMethod.null operation is an identity operation; no fields
 * are altered. In this implementation, since no compression is supported,
 * uncompressed records are always the same as compressed records.
 *
 * Encryption Information:
 *
 * The encryption and MAC functions translate a TLSCompressed structure into a
 * TLSCiphertext. The decryption functions reverse the process. The MAC of the
 * record also includes a sequence number so that missing, extra, or repeated
 * messages are detectable.
 *
 * struct {
 *   ContentType type;
 *   ProtocolVersion version;
 *   uint16 length;
 *   select (SecurityParameters.cipher_type) {
 *     case stream: GenericStreamCipher;
 *     case block:  GenericBlockCipher;
 *     case aead:   GenericAEADCipher;
 *   } fragment;
 * } TLSCiphertext;
 *
 * type:
 *   The type field is identical to TLSCompressed.type.
 *
 * version:
 *   The version field is identical to TLSCompressed.version.
 *
 * length:
 *   The length (in bytes) of the following TLSCiphertext.fragment.
 *   The length MUST NOT exceed 2^14 + 2048.
 *
 * fragment:
 *   The encrypted form of TLSCompressed.fragment, with the MAC.
 *
 * Note: Only CBC Block Ciphers are supported by this implementation.
 *
 * The TLSCompressed.fragment structures are converted to/from block
 * TLSCiphertext.fragment structures.
 *
 * struct {
 *   opaque IV[SecurityParameters.record_iv_length];
 *   block-ciphered struct {
 *     opaque content[TLSCompressed.length];
 *     opaque MAC[SecurityParameters.mac_length];
 *     uint8 padding[GenericBlockCipher.padding_length];
 *     uint8 padding_length;
 *   };
 * } GenericBlockCipher;
 *
 * The MAC is generated as described in Section 6.2.3.1.
 *
 * IV:
 *   The Initialization Vector (IV) SHOULD be chosen at random, and MUST be
 *   unpredictable. Note that in versions of TLS prior to 1.1, there was no
 *   IV field, and the last ciphertext block of the previous record (the "CBC
 *   residue") was used as the IV. This was changed to prevent the attacks
 *   described in [CBCATT]. For block ciphers, the IV length is of length
 *   SecurityParameters.record_iv_length, which is equal to the
 *   SecurityParameters.block_size.
 *
 * padding:
 *   Padding that is added to force the length of the plaintext to be an
 *   integral multiple of the block cipher's block length. The padding MAY be
 *   any length up to 255 bytes, as long as it results in the
 *   TLSCiphertext.length being an integral multiple of the block length.
 *   Lengths longer than necessary might be desirable to frustrate attacks on
 *   a protocol that are based on analysis of the lengths of exchanged
 *   messages. Each uint8 in the padding data vector MUST be filled with the
 *   padding length value. The receiver MUST check this padding and MUST use
 *   the bad_record_mac alert to indicate padding errors.
 *
 * padding_length:
 *   The padding length MUST be such that the total size of the
 *   GenericBlockCipher structure is a multiple of the cipher's block length.
 *   Legal values range from zero to 255, inclusive. This length specifies the
 *   length of the padding field exclusive of the padding_length field itself.
 *
 * The encrypted data length (TLSCiphertext.length) is one more than the sum of
 * SecurityParameters.block_length, TLSCompressed.length,
 * SecurityParameters.mac_length, and padding_length.
 *
 * Example: If the block length is 8 bytes, the content length
 * (TLSCompressed.length) is 61 bytes, and the MAC length is 20 bytes, then the
 * length before padding is 82 bytes (this does not include the IV. Thus, the
 * padding length modulo 8 must be equal to 6 in order to make the total length
 * an even multiple of 8 bytes (the block length). The padding length can be
 * 6, 14, 22, and so on, through 254. If the padding length were the minimum
 * necessary, 6, the padding would be 6 bytes, each containing the value 6.
 * Thus, the last 8 octets of the GenericBlockCipher before block encryption
 * would be xx 06 06 06 06 06 06 06, where xx is the last octet of the MAC.
 *
 * Note: With block ciphers in CBC mode (Cipher Block Chaining), it is critical
 * that the entire plaintext of the record be known before any ciphertext is
 * transmitted. Otherwise, it is possible for the attacker to mount the attack
 * described in [CBCATT].
 *
 * Implementation note: Canvel et al. [CBCTIME] have demonstrated a timing
 * attack on CBC padding based on the time required to compute the MAC. In
 * order to defend against this attack, implementations MUST ensure that
 * record processing time is essentially the same whether or not the padding
 * is correct. In general, the best way to do this is to compute the MAC even
 * if the padding is incorrect, and only then reject the packet. For instance,
 * if the pad appears to be incorrect, the implementation might assume a
 * zero-length pad and then compute the MAC. This leaves a small timing
 * channel, since MAC performance depends, to some extent, on the size of the
 * data fragment, but it is not believed to be large enough to be exploitable,
 * due to the large block size of existing MACs and the small size of the
 * timing signal.

/**
 * The transistional state tables for receiving TLS records. It maps the
 * current TLS engine state and a received record to a function to handle the
 * record and update the state.
 *
 * For instance, if the current state is SHE, then the TLS engine is expecting
 * a ServerHello record. Once a record is received, the handler function is
 * looked up using the state SHE and the record's content type.
 *
 * The resulting function will either be an error handler or a record handler.
 * The function will take whatever action is appropriate and update the state
 * for the next record.
 *
 * The states are all based on possible server record types. Note that the
 * client will never specifically expect to receive a HelloRequest or an alert
 * from the server so there is no state that reflects this. These messages may
 * occur at any time.
 *
 * There are two tables for mapping states because there is a second tier of
 * types for handshake messages. Once a record with a content type of handshake
 * is received, the handshake record handler will look up the handshake type in
 * the secondary map to get its appropriate handler.
 *

/**
 * Generates the master_secret and keys using the given security parameters.
 *
 * The security parameters for a TLS connection state are defined as such:
 *
 * struct {
 *   ConnectionEnd          entity;
 *   PRFAlgorithm           prf_algorithm;
 *   BulkCipherAlgorithm    bulk_cipher_algorithm;
 *   CipherType             cipher_type;
 *   uint8                  enc_key_length;
 *   uint8                  block_length;
 *   uint8                  fixed_iv_length;

 *   CompressionMethod      compression_algorithm;
 *   opaque                 master_secret[48];
 *   opaque                 client_random[32];
 *   opaque                 server_random[32];
 * } SecurityParameters;
 *
 * Note that this definition is from TLS 1.2. In TLS 1.0 some of these
 * parameters are ignored because, for instance, the PRFAlgorithm is a
 * builtin-fixed algorithm combining iterations of MD5 and SHA-1 in TLS 1.0.
 *
 * The Record Protocol requires an algorithm to generate keys required by the
 * current connection state.
 *
 * The master secret is expanded into a sequence of secure bytes, which is then
 * split to a client write MAC key, a server write MAC key, a client write
 * encryption key, and a server write encryption key. In TLS 1.0 a client write
 * IV and server write IV are also generated. Each of these is generated from
 * the byte sequence in that order. Unused values are empty. In TLS 1.2, some
 * AEAD ciphers may additionally require a client write IV and a server write
 * IV (see Section 6.2.3.3).
 *
 * When keys, MAC keys, and IVs are generated, the master secret is used as an
 * entropy source.
 *
 * To generate the key material, compute:
 *
 * master_secret = PRF(pre_master_secret, "master secret",
 *                     ClientHello.random + ServerHello.random)
 *
 * key_block = PRF(SecurityParameters.master_secret,
 *                 "key expansion",
 *                 SecurityParameters.server_random +
 *                 SecurityParameters.client_random);
 *
 * until enough output has been generated. Then, the key_block is
 * partitioned as follows:
 *
 * client_write_MAC_key[SecurityParameters.mac_key_length]
 * server_write_MAC_key[SecurityParameters.mac_key_length]
 * client_write_key[SecurityParameters.enc_key_length]
 * server_write_key[SecurityParameters.enc_key_length]
 * client_write_IV[SecurityParameters.fixed_iv_length]
 * server_write_IV[SecurityParameters.fixed_iv_length]
 *
 * In TLS 1.2, the client_write_IV and server_write_IV are only generated for
 * implicit nonce techniques as described in Section 3.2.1 of [AEAD]. This
 * implementation uses TLS 1.0 so IVs are generated.
 *
 * Implementation note: The currently defined cipher suite which requires the
 * most material is AES_256_CBC_SHA256. It requires 2 x 32 byte keys and 2 x 32
 * byte MAC keys, for a total 128 bytes of key material. In TLS 1.0 it also
 * requires 2 x 16 byte IVs, so it actually takes 160 bytes of key material.
 *
 * @param c the connection.
 * @param sp the security parameters to use.
 *
 * @return the security keys.

 * Creates a new TLS connection. This does not make any assumptions about the
 * transport layer that TLS is working on top of, ie: it does not assume there
 * is a TCP/IP connection or establish one. A TLS connection is totally
 * abstracted away from the layer is runs on top of, it merely establishes a
 * secure channel between a client" and a "server".
 *
 * A TLS connection contains 4 connection states: pending read and write, and
 * current read and write.
 *
 * At initialization, the current read and write states will be null. Only once
 * the security parameters have been set and the keys have been generated can
 * the pending states be converted into current states. Current states will be
 * updated for each record processed.
 *
 * A custom certificate verify callback may be provided to check information
 * like the common name on the server's certificate. It will be called for
 * every certificate in the chain. It has the following signature:
 *
 * variable func(c, certs, index, preVerify)
 * Where:
 * c         The TLS connection
 * verified  Set to true if certificate was verified, otherwise the alert
 *           tls.Alert.Description for why the certificate failed.
 * depth     The current index in the chain, where 0 is the server's cert.
 * certs     The certificate chain, *NOTE* if the server was anonymous then
 *           the chain will be empty.
 *
 * The function returns true on success and on failure either the appropriate
 * tls.Alert.Description or an object with 'alert' set to the appropriate
 * tls.Alert.Description and 'message' set to a custom error message. If true
 * is not returned then the connection will abort using, in order of
 * availability, first the returned alert description, second the preVerify
 * alert description, and lastly the default 'bad_certificate'.
 *
 * There are three callbacks that can be used to make use of client-side
 * certificates where each takes the TLS connection as the first parameter:
 *
 * getCertificate(conn, hint)
 *   The second parameter is a hint as to which certificate should be
 *   returned. If the connection entity is a client, then the hint will be
 *   the CertificateRequest message from the server that is part of the
 *   TLS protocol. If the connection entity is a server, then it will be
 *   the servername list provided via an SNI extension the ClientHello, if
 *   one was provided (empty array if not). The hint can be examined to
 *   determine which certificate to use (advanced). Most implementations
 *   will just return a certificate. The return value must be a
 *   PEM-formatted certificate or an array of PEM-formatted certificates
 *   that constitute a certificate chain, with the first in the array/chain
 *   being the client's certificate.
 * getPrivateKey(conn, certificate)
 *   The second parameter is an forge.pki X.509 certificate object that
 *   is associated with the requested private key. The return value must
 *   be a PEM-formatted private key.
 * getSignature(conn, bytes, callback)
 *   This callback can be used instead of getPrivateKey if the private key
 *   is not directly accessible in javascript or should not be. For
 *   instance, a secure external web service could provide the signature
 *   in exchange for appropriate credentials. The second parameter is a
 *   string of bytes to be signed that are part of the TLS protocol. These
 *   bytes are used to verify that the private key for the previously
 *   provided client-side certificate is accessible to the client. The
 *   callback is a function that takes 2 parameters, the TLS connection
 *   and the RSA encrypted (signed) bytes as a string. This callback must
 *   be called once the signature is ready.
 *
 * @param options the options for this connection:
 *   server: true if the connection is server-side, false for client.
 *   sessionId: a session ID to reuse, null for a new connection.
 *   caStore: an array of certificates to trust.
 *   sessionCache: a session cache to use.
 *   cipherSuites: an optional array of cipher suites to use,
 *     see tls.CipherSuites.
 *   connected: function(conn) called when the first handshake completes.
 *   virtualHost: the virtual server name to use in a TLS SNI extension.
 *   verifyClient: true to require a client certificate in server mode,
 *     'optional' to request one, false not to (default: false).
 *   verify: a handler used to custom verify certificates in the chain.
 *   verifyOptions: an object with options for the certificate chain validation.
 *     See documentation of pki.verifyCertificateChain for possible options.
 *     verifyOptions.verify is ignored. If you wish to specify a verify handler
 *     use the verify key.
 *   getCertificate: an optional callback used to get a certificate or
 *     a chain of certificates (as an array).
 *   getPrivateKey: an optional callback used to get a private key.
 *   getSignature: an optional callback used to get a signature.
 *   tlsDataReady: function(conn) called when TLS protocol data has been
 *     prepared and is ready to be used (typically sent over a socket
 *     connection to its destination), read from conn.tlsData buffer.
 *   dataReady: function(conn) called when application data has
 *     been parsed from a TLS record and should be consumed by the
 *     application, read from conn.data buffer.
 *   closed: function(conn) called when the connection has been closed.
 *   error: function(conn, error) called when there was an error.
 *   deflate: function(inBytes) if provided, will deflate TLS records using
 *     the deflate algorithm if the server supports it.
 *   inflate: function(inBytes) if provided, will inflate TLS records using
 *     the deflate algorithm if the server supports it.
 *
 * @return the new TLS connection.

  /* From: RFC3280 - Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate
    Section 6: Certification Path Validation
    See inline parentheticals related to this particular implementation.

    The primary goal of path validation is to verify the binding between
    a subject distinguished name or a subject alternative name and subject
    public key, as represented in the end entity certificate, based on the
    public key of the trust anchor. This requires obtaining a sequence of
    certificates that support that binding. That sequence should be provided
    in the passed 'chain'. The trust anchor should be in the given CA
    store. The 'end entity' certificate is the certificate provided by the
    end point (typically a server) and is the first in the chain.

    To meet this goal, the path validation process verifies, among other
    things, that a prospective certification path (a sequence of n
    certificates or a 'chain') satisfies the following conditions:

    (a) for all x in {1, ..., n-1}, the subject of certificate x is
          the issuer of certificate x+1;

    (b) certificate 1 is issued by the trust anchor;

    (c) certificate n is the certificate to be validated; and

    (d) for all x in {1, ..., n}, the certificate was valid at the
          time in question.

    Note that here 'n' is index 0 in the chain and 1 is the last certificate
    in the chain and it must be signed by a certificate in the connection's
    CA store.

    The path validation process also determines the set of certificate
    policies that are valid for this path, based on the certificate policies
    extension, policy mapping extension, policy constraints extension, and
    inhibit any-policy extension.

    Note: Policy mapping extension not supported (Not Required).

    Note: If the certificate has an unsupported critical extension, then it
    must be rejected.

    Note: A certificate is self-issued if the DNs that appear in the subject
    and issuer fields are identical and are not empty.

    The path validation algorithm assumes the following seven inputs are
    provided to the path processing logic. What this specific implementation
    will use is provided parenthetically:

    (a) a prospective certification path of length n (the 'chain')
    (b) the current date/time: ('now').
    (c) user-initial-policy-set: A set of certificate policy identifiers
          naming the policies that are acceptable to the certificate user.
          The user-initial-policy-set contains the special value any-policy
          if the user is not concerned about certificate policy
          (Not implemented. Any policy is accepted).
    (d) trust anchor information, describing a CA that serves as a trust
          anchor for the certification path. The trust anchor information
          includes:

      (1)  the trusted issuer name,
      (2)  the trusted public key algorithm,
      (3)  the trusted public key, and
      (4)  optionally, the trusted public key parameters associated
             with the public key.

      (Trust anchors are provided via certificates in the CA store).

      The trust anchor information may be provided to the path processing
      procedure in the form of a self-signed certificate. The trusted anchor
      information is trusted because it was delivered to the path processing

  /* Basic Path Processing:

    For each certificate in the 'chain', the following is checked:

    1. The certificate validity period includes the current time.
    2. The certificate was signed by its parent (where the parent is either
       the next in the chain or from the CA store). Allow processing to
       continue to the next step if no parent is found but the certificate is
       in the CA store.
    3. TODO: The certificate has not been revoked.
    4. The certificate issuer name matches the parent's subject name.
    5. TODO: If the certificate is self-issued and not the final certificate
       in the chain, skip this step, otherwise verify that the subject name
       is within one of the permitted subtrees of X.500 distinguished names
       and that each of the alternative names in the subjectAltName extension
       (critical or non-critical) is within one of the permitted subtrees for
       that name type.
    6. TODO: If the certificate is self-issued and not the final certificate
       in the chain, skip this step, otherwise verify that the subject name
       is not within one of the excluded subtrees for X.500 distinguished
       names and none of the subjectAltName extension names are excluded for
       that name type.
    7. The other steps in the algorithm for basic path processing involve
       handling the policy extension which is not presently supported in this
       implementation. Instead, if a critical policy extension is found, the
       certificate is rejected as not supported.
    8. If the certificate is not the first or if its the only certificate in
       the chain (having no parent from the CA store or is self-signed) and it
       has a critical key usage extension, verify that the keyCertSign bit is
       set. If the key usage extension exists, verify that the basic
       constraints extension exists. If the basic constraints extension exists,
       verify that the cA flag is set. If pathLenConstraint is set, ensure that
       the number of certificates that precede in the chain (come earlier
       in the chain as implemented below), excluding the very first in the
       chain (typically the end-entity one), isn't greater than the
       pathLenConstraint. This constraint limits the number of intermediate
       CAs that may appear below a CA before only end-entity certificates
       may be issued. */

// a transform stream is a readable/writable stream where you do
// something with the data.  Sometimes it's called a "filter",
// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where
// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would
// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)
//
// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a
// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,
// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then
// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.
//
// Here's how this works:
//
// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable
// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)
// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes
// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until
// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.
//
// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When
// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the
// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single
// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first
// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into
// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.
//
// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,
// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,
// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering
// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is
// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many
// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in
// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small
// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In
// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell
// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could
// cause the system to run out of memory.
//
// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk
// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until
// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.
